        <p class="lead">Mason, the delightful three-year-old Terrier, is a compact bundle of personality and charm. With his wiry coat, soulful eyes, and perky ears that always seem to be on high alert, he's a small dog with a big presence. Mason's feisty and spirited nature is a testament to the Terrier breed's characteristic spunk and intelligence.

        <p class="lead">
          Mason's story begins with an uncertain past. He was once a companion to a family who, for reasons we may never fully know, could no longer provide him with the care and attention he deserved. It's possible that changes in their lives, such as moving to a place where pets weren't allowed or facing unforeseen challenges, led to the difficult decision to surrender Mason to the shelter.</p>
