          <p class="lead">Jack is a happy and friendly 5-year-old hound who is as loyal as can be! With his floppy ears and soulful eyes, he's a real charmer. Jack loves to run and play in the backyard, chasing after all the fascinating scents he finds. He's the best companion for adventures in the great outdoors.

            Jack's fur is a beautiful mix of brown and black, and it's so soft to the touch. He's a big fan of belly rubs and ear scratches, and he'll wag his tail with delight when you give him some love.</p>

          <p class="lead">
            Jack's journey to the shelter began when a caring individual discovered him all by himself and decided to take him to the shelter. The day was filled with uncertainty and worry for Jack. Now, he's at the shelter, missing the warmth and comfort of a loving home. He's patiently waiting for a kind family to come and adopt him, so he can have a second chance at happiness and security.</p>
